Overview

This project aims to build an advanced machine learning model to detect skin cancer from medical images.
The goal is to leverage computer vision and data analysis techniques to classify skin lesions as either cancerous or non-cancerous, and to explore correlations with patient demographic and clinical data.

By applying preprocessing, feature extraction, and deep learning models, we aim to improve prediction accuracy and create a deployable solution for real-world use.

Objectives

Data Acquisition: Gather raw skin lesion images and accompanying metadata from trusted medical sources.
Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:
Handle missing metadata values.
Resize and normalize images.
Apply augmentation to improve model generalization.
Image Classification: Train deep learning models (CNN / Transfer Learning) to classify skin lesions.
Multimodal Analysis: Combine image data with patient information (age, gender, location) for improved predictions.
Model Evaluation: Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Visualization & Reporting: Create visual dashboards for findings and model performance.
